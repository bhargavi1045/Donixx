## **Problem Statement** 

- Despite rapid advancements in medical technology, organ donation in India still faces several challenges. The current system is mostly manual, unorganized, and lacks awareness among the general public. Many potential donors are unaware of the process, and even those who wish to contribute face difficulty in registering and finding the right hospital or authority. There is also a major gap in interpreting complex medical reports and ensuring proper post-donation care. This results in low donor participation, delayed decision-making, and poor follow-up for patients.

- There is a strong need for a centralized and digital platform that can simplify the entire donation process — from registration and hospital discovery to AI-powered medical report analysis and continuous post-donation support. Such a system can not only promote awareness but also bring transparency, improve medical coordination, and increase the efficiency of organ donation across the country.

## **Our Solution - Donix**

## Why Donix Stands Out

- **AI-based Donor-Recipient Compatibility Matching** - Intelligent matching based on blood type, organ type, urgency level, and geographic proximity.

- **AI Medical Report Analysis** - Users can upload their medical reports and receive instant AI-generated insights, reducing dependency on long wait times for interpretations and enabling early decisions for both donors and recipients.

- **AI-Driven Recovery Routine** - Post-donation care is personalized using AI-generated health routines and reminders, ensuring donors and recipients get timely attention, diet alerts, exercise guidance, and medication schedules.

- **Smart Notifications and Status Updates** - Automatic SMS/email updates for important events — match found, appointment reminders, post-care alerts, etc.

- **Community Awareness Hub** - To boost public participation, Donix features a dedicated space for sharing real-life donor stories, health blogs, upcoming camps, webinars, and awareness events – creating a sense of belonging and impact.

- **Military-Grade Data Security** - Security is non-negotiable. Donix uses blockchain technology and military-grade encryption to ensure that all health data is securely stored and shared only with user consent.

- **Verified Hospital Explorer** - Users can explore hospitals based on real-time reviews, treatment availability, and success rates — and even book appointments through the platform for hassle-free coordination.

- **Organ Availability Tracking** - Donix introduces a live dashboard that tracks organ availability across partnered hospitals, bringing transparency and speed to a process that traditionally relied on manual communication.

- **Instant Donor Registration** - Donix enables a fast and guided digital sign-up process for both donors and recipients. Users can register in just a few steps, with real-time access to verified hospital listings based on location and specialization.

- **Digital Health Vault** - All health records, reports, and interactions stored securely and made accessible for both patients and doctors as needed.
