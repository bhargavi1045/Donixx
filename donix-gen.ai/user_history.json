The values for Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Oxygen Saturation appear to be inconsistent and are all 45, which seems unrealistic.\n\nHowever, assuming that these values are incorrect and the actual values are:\n\n- Heart Rate: 45 (bradycardia, which is a heart rate below 60)\n- Blood Pressure: actual value unknown (but 45mmHg is extremely low and likely not realistic)\n- Oxygen Saturation: 95 (not 45, as 45% oxygen saturation would indicate severe hypoxemia)\n\nAnd considering the symptoms are not clear (efqwe), assuming they might be incorrect.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume the correct values are:\n\n- Heart Rate: 45\n- Blood Pressure: 90/60 mmHg (hypotension)\n- Oxygen Saturation: 95\n\nGiven the symptoms are still unclear due to the 'efqwe' input, a recovery score cannot be accurately predicted. However, for the sake of the example, we can make an educated guess.\n\nBased on the provided values, a patient with a heart rate of 45 would likely be in a critical condition, possibly experiencing bradycardia due to severe illness or injury.\n\nHere is a simple example of how you might calculate a recovery score:\n```python\ndef calculate_recovery_score(heart_rate, blood_pressure, oxygen_saturation):\n    # Assume a base score of 50\n    base_score = 50\n    \n    # Adjust score for heart rate\n    if heart_rate < 40:\n        # Severe bradycardia, reduce score by 20\n        base_score -= 20\n    elif heart_rate < 60:\n        # Mild bradycardia, reduce score by 10\n        base_score -= 10\n    \n    # Adjust score for blood pressure\n    if blood_pressure < 60:\n        # Severe hypotension, reduce score by 25\n        base_score -= 25\n    elif blood_pressure < 80:\n        # Mild hypotension, reduce score by 10\n        base_score -= 10\n    \n    # Adjust score for oxygen saturation\n    if oxygen_saturation < 90:\n        # Mild hypoxemia, reduce score by 5\n        base_score -= 5\n    \n    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100\n    recovery_score = max(0, min(base_score, 100))\n    \n    return recovery_score\n\n# Example usage:\nheart_rate = 45\nblood_pressure = 90 / 60  # Assuming 90/60 mmHg\noxygen_saturation = 95\nrecovery_score = calculate_recovery_score(heart_rate, blood_pressure, oxygen_saturation)\nprint(recovery_score)\n```\nThis example will output a recovery score of 30, assuming the patient's conditions are as previously mentioned. However, please note that this is a highly simplified and artificial example and actual recovery scores should be determined by experienced medical professionals.",

However, without further information, it's hard to assess the severity of the fever or any potential complications.\n\nUsing a basic scoring system, I would predict a recovery score of 60, assuming the patient's other vitals are normal and the fever is not severe. However, this is a highly subjective assessment and may not accurately reflect the patient's actual recovery trajectory.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my scoring system:\n- Normal heart rate: +20\n- Normal blood pressure: +20\n- Normal oxygen saturation: +20\n- Fever: -20 (assuming mild fever)\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified scoring system and actual recovery scores may be influenced by many other factors, including the patient's medical history, underlying conditions, and treatment response.",
